# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern web framework that delivers lightning-fast performance by shipping zero JavaScript by default. Here's why you should consider it for your next project.

## Why Astro?

### Performance First
Astro generates static HTML at build time, resulting in faster page loads and better SEO.

### Component Islands
Use your favorite framework (React, Vue, Svelte) only where you need it. Astro calls this "Islands Architecture."

### Great Developer Experience
- Write components in `.astro` files
- Use your favorite tools and frameworks
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Fast dev server with HMR

## Quick Start

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

That's all you need to get started! The CLI will guide you through the setup process.

## Next Steps

Once you have your project set up, explore:
- Content Collections for type-safe markdown
- Integrations for Tailwind, React, and more
- Deployment options (Cloudflare, Vercel, Netlify)

Happy building!
